# thermal-dosimetry-surrogate

The repository contains the code for the paper *Standardized Benchmark Dataset for Localized Exposure to a Realistic Source at 10-90 GHz*.

This repository is related to the following conference papers:
* *Standardized Benchmark Dataset for Localized Exposure to a Realistic Source at 10-90 GHz*, in proceedings of [BioEM 2023](https://www.bioem2023.org/)
* *Prediction of Maximum Temperature Rise on Skin Surface for Local Exposure at 10-90 GHz*, in proceedings of [URSI GASS 2023](https://www.ursi-gass2023.jp/)

To reproduce the results, easiest way is to create a local environment by using `conda` as
```shell
conda create --name thermal-dosimetry-surrogate python=3.9.12
```
and, inside the environment, within `code` repository, run the following command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
