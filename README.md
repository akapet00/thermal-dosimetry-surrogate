# thermal-dosimetry-surrogate

The repository contains the code for figures/results in work-in-progress papers for the URSI GASS 2023 and BioEM 2023 conference.


To reproduce the results, easiest way is to create a local environment by using `conda` as
```shell
conda create --name thermal-dosimetry-surrogate python=3.9.12
```
and, inside the environment, within `code` repository, run the following command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
